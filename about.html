										<h4>Society is very often oblivious to the plight of young homeless
											People who have no one to ask for help. Taking on the
											responsibility of such people and their children is considered as
											an added burden, and can be seen in the obvious lack of facilities
											and aid which is made available to them. Although in recent times
											the idea of child rights has garnered increased public attention,
											women’s rights have barely broken the surface. While trying to
											solve the problems related to homeless people, more often than
											not, some aspects are overlooked such as emphasis on gender
											without equal accountability given to the role played by caste;
											overshadowing mental health when discussing economic development,
											etc. <br>
										  
										  
											Our Vision of a just, equitable and compassionate society where
											young women pursue their lives with freedom and dignity.
											<br>
										  
										  
											Our Mission is to act as a catalyst for homeless people by
											facilitating their journey to access fundamental needs, reclaim
											their identity by building an exemplary, replicable model that
											provides opportunities for their economic, psychological,
											emotional, civil and social development.
